# Creative Writing Assistant

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered creative writing assistant that generates short stories based on user-provided prompts. It uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 model trained on the WritingPrompts dataset.

## Features
- Generate creative stories from prompts.
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 model for better story generation.
- Flask API for real-time story generation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/creative-writing-assistant.git
   cd creative-writing-assistant
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
1. Training
   To fine tune the GPT2 model
   ``` bash
   python train.py
2. Inference
   To generate a story from a prompt:
   ```bash
   python inference.py --prompt "In a world where magic is real,"
3. Deployment
   To deploy the Flask API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   Send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/generate_story with a JSON payload:
   ``` JSON
   {
      "prompt": "In a world where magic is real,"
   }
Example Output
Prompt: "In a world where magic is real,"
Generated Story:
"In a world where magic is real, a young girl discovers a hidden portal to a realm of ancient wizards. She must learn to harness her newfound powers to save her village from an impending doom..."
